# Releases

This page tracks notable changes in Apache Superset Kubernetes Operator releases.

## Unreleased

### Changed

- Kubernetes support now covers the three newest `kind`-published minor versions instead of two. CI tests Kubernetes 1.37, 1.36, and 1.35 natively, with the experimental `next` lane disabled again ([#317](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/317)).

### Fixed

- The operator-managed maintenance page now sets `seccompProfile: RuntimeDefault` on its container, so it is admitted in namespaces enforcing the restricted Pod Security Standard (its other hardened defaults were already set, but the missing seccomp profile caused rejection) ([#362](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/362), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).

### Security

- **Breaking:** CRs with `serviceAccount.create=true` (or unset) and `serviceAccount.name != metadata.name` are now rejected at admission. To use a pre-existing ServiceAccount with a different name, set `serviceAccount.create=false` ([#324](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/324), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).
- **Breaking:** Valkey cache and results-backend `keyPrefix` values are now constrained to `^[A-Za-z0-9._:-]*$` (max 128 characters); values containing spaces, slashes, or other characters outside that set are rejected. The safer rendering also causes a one-time config-checksum change and pod roll on upgrade ([#325](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/325), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).
- Seed `excludeTables`, `excludeTableData`, and `postSeedSQL` values are now passed literally to generated seed scripts; values that previously relied on shell expansion no longer expand ([#325](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/325), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).
- **Breaking:** Celery Flower is no longer published on the Ingress/Gateway surface in `Production` by default. Flower's default command ships without authentication and its dashboard discloses task names and arguments — for Superset, other users' async SQL Lab statements and alert/report payloads. In `Production` (the default) Flower is fanned out onto the end-user host — and its port opened in the built-in NetworkPolicy — only when you explicitly set `celeryFlower.service.gatewayPath`; `Development` and `Staging` continue to publish it by default. To keep exposing Flower in Production, set `celeryFlower.service.gatewayPath` (e.g. `/flower`) after placing authentication in front of it (e.g. `FLOWER_BASIC_AUTH` injected from a Secret via `celeryFlower.podTemplate.container.env`) ([#279](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/279), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).
- **Breaking:** A `Production` Superset CR can no longer be changed in place to `Development` or `Staging`; delete and recreate the instance to change environment out of `Production`. Upgrades toward `Production` and non-Production transitions are unaffected ([#327](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/327), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).

## 0.2.0 - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **Seconds and year precision in `cronSchedule`.** Lifecycle task `cronSchedule` fields now accept 6- and 7-field cron expressions in addition to the classic 5-field form — an optional leading seconds field and/or trailing year field (e.g. `*/30 * * * * *` every 30 seconds, `0 0 2 * * * 2027`). Existing 5-field schedules are unaffected ([#238](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/238), [@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).
- **Helm `imagePullSecrets`.** The Helm chart now exposes an `imagePullSecrets` value that sets `spec.template.spec.imagePullSecrets` on the operator Deployment, letting operators pull the manager image from a private registry. The referenced Secrets must already exist in the release namespace — the chart does not create them ([#240](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/240), [@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).
- **Helm `topologySpreadConstraints`.** The Helm chart now exposes a `topologySpreadConstraints` value that sets `spec.template.spec.topologySpreadConstraints` on the operator Deployment, letting operators distribute manager pods across failure domains such as nodes and zones ([#213](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/213), [@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).
- **Helm `revisionHistoryLimit`.** The Helm chart now exposes a `revisionHistoryLimit` value that allows setting `spec.revisionHistoryLimit` on the operator Deployment, capping the number of old ReplicaSets retained for rollback ([@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).
- **Helm extra manifests.** The Helm chart now supports `extraManifests` for rendering trusted, release-scoped Kubernetes manifests with Helm `tpl`. Use it for companion resources owned by the operator release, not shared cluster infrastructure such as Gateway API controllers, CRDs, or shared Gateways ([#196](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/196), [@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).
- **Helm resize policy.** The Helm chart now supports `resizePolicy` on the manager container, controlling whether an in-place pod resize (InPlacePodVerticalScaling) restarts the container ([#200](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/200), [@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).

### Changed

- **Breaking:** renamed the "version" status fields to "tag". `status.version` → `status.tag` (the `kubectl get` column is renamed **Version** → **Tag**), and `status.lifecycle.upgrade.fromVersion`/`toVersion` → `fromTag`/`toTag`. No behavior change.
- **Breaking:** downgrade blocking is removed. Any change to the lifecycle image tag now re-runs the migrate task (`superset db upgrade`) regardless of direction — the operator no longer performs semver comparison or sets `status.phase: Blocked` on a version decrease. The migrate task only runs `superset db upgrade` (Superset's down migrations are poorly tested and often break, so the operator never runs them), so take a database backup before an upgrade if you may need to revert. The `direction` field is removed from `status.lifecycle.upgrade`, and the `VersionComparisonSkipped` warning event no longer fires.
- **Breaking:** the lifecycle `clone` task is renamed to `seed`. Rename `spec.lifecycle.clone` to `spec.lifecycle.seed` (and its `postCloneSQL` field to `postSeedSQL`) in your Superset resources. The task Job name suffix changes from `-clone` to `-seed`, and the lifecycle status phase from `Cloning` to `Seeding`. Custom `seed.command` scripts must read the renamed `SUPERSET_OPERATOR__SEED_SRC_*` environment variables.

### Security

- **Credential redaction in task failure output.** Lifecycle task failure messages are now scrubbed with best-effort pattern-based redaction before being persisted to the parent Superset status and Kubernetes Events: passwords embedded in connection URIs and common credential assignments (`password=...`, `token=...`, etc.) are masked. This mitigates the known limitation where a failing task command could leak credential fragments into status ([@younsl](https://github.com/younsl)).

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-29

### Fixed

- Honor HPA-managed replica counts: the operator no longer overwrites the replica count on Deployments whose scaling is owned by a HorizontalPodAutoscaler ([#152](https://github.com/apache/superset-kubernetes-operator/pull/152), [@pashtet04](https://github.com/pashtet04)).

## 0.1.0 - 2026-06-10

### Added

- Initial release ([@villebro](https://github.com/villebro)).

### Known limitations

- **Websocket server is experimental.** The websocket server is not yet well supported and is pending security hardening; it is not recommended for production use.
- **Downgrade protection requires semver image tags.** Downgrades are detected and blocked only when both image tags are valid semver. Non-semver tags (`latest`, date stamps, digest pins) cannot be ordered, so the operator emits a `VersionComparisonSkipped` warning and proceeds without blocking. See [Lifecycle](../user-guide/lifecycle.md).
- **Task failure messages may include credential fragments.** Lifecycle task failure output is truncated into `status` and could contain fragments of task stdout, including credentials. See [security.md](security.md).
